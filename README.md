Machine learning using SciKit Learn, covering techniques like Linear Regression, K Nearest Neighbours, K Means Clustering, Decision Trees, and Random Forests for data- driven insights and problem-solving.

**Data Scientist @ NFQ, London (_June 2020 - 2021_)**
- Collaborated closely with the Data Science team to incorporate real stock data into the pricing model, bridging theory with practical application and engaged in regular knowledge-sharing sessions with team members, fostering an environment of continuous learning and skill development.
- Defended the chosen mathematical approaches through rigorous testing, sensitivity analysis, and validation. Communicated the findings to stakeholders, building trust in the model's capabilities.
- Successfully managed the project under tight deadlines, overcoming challenges of working with real-world data, and delivering an accurate and user-friendly Pricer.
Key achievements: Created an interactive option pricing model that was successfully put in production and sold to Tier 1 Investment Bank clients. The project was well received by senior stakeholders of the firm and gained additional funding for the Data Science Team.

**Consultant, Advisory @ SANTANDER VIA NFQ, LONDON(_2019 - 2020_)**
- Resolved complex technical, strategic, and business-related issues; Provided strategic guidance in navigating
business-related issues, such as market volatility, regulatory changes, and competitive pressures.
Key Achievement: Saved the client £9M by discovering certain types of trades that were heavily penalised by the new regulation, therefore helping the business change their strategy.
**ASSOCIATE, ADVISORY @ SANTANDER VIA NFQ, LONDON(_2018 - 2019_)**
- Played a pivotal role as a Project Managing Officer and Business Analyst, resulting in the successful implementation of the UK Strategy within the Global Steer Co at Santander Investment Bank.
- Key Achievement: client was compliant with the PRA, extended on the project based on performance.

**ANALYST, CREDIT RISK @ ELEVATE CREDIT, LONDON(_2017 - 2018_)**
- Enhanced the New Customer Acquisition Strategy and optimised lending strategy using R, continuously
monitored the performance of the acquisition strategy, making data-backed adjustments and refinements to
optimise lending decisions and enhance portfolio performance
Key Achievement: spotted a new customer trend that was used to improve our lending model generating £1.5 million in revenue


## CAREER BREAK (_2021 - 2023_)

## Projects
### Credit Model:  Loan Predictions through Advanced Feature Engineering and TensorFlow
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Harnessing TensorFlow's capabilities, this project conducts advanced risk assessment using a curated subset of LendingClub data. Through meticulous feature engineering, it aims to predict borrower loan repayment probabilities, empowering informed lending decisions

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
